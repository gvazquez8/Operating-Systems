ashell has been completely implememented.
!!Piping is not implemented.!!

This shell also supports command history (10 items) which the user can navigate
with the UP and DOWN arrow keys. Audible bell will occur if trying to access
beyond the history. In addition, users can use the BACKSPACE and DEL keys to
remove characters from current line.

When taking input from user, shell will print out the current directory followed
by the % sign to signal the current directory. If path is > 16 characters then
the path is written as /.../[LAST DIRECTORY IN PATH].
