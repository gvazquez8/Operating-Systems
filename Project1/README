Files Included:
	README
	Makefile
	noncanmode.cpp

----------------------------INSTRUCTIONS----------------------------------------

1. Extract ashell.tgz

2. Run the command "make"
3. Execute program with "./ashell"

------------------------Project Functionality-----------------------------------

Currently, there are select few of commands that are supported.

These are:
	1. pwd - print current directory
	2. cd [DIRECTORY] - changes directory to DIRECTORY. If DIRECTORY is not
		provided, change to directory specified by the HOME environment
		variable.

		args for cd:
			1. cd .. - go up a directory in path / leave current directory
			2. cd / - go to root directory
			3. cd \ - go to directory specified by HOME env variable.
			4. cd [DIRECTORY] - change directory to DIRECTORY, must be a
				relative path
			5. cd /[DIRECTORY] - change directory to DIRECTORY, must be absolute
				path

		ERRORS:
			If DIRECTORY is specified, but unable to change directories to it,
			then a "No such directory" error printed.
	3. exit - close application

Unimplemented commands do not perform their intended action, but rather output
the command plus arguments to console.

This shell also supports command history (10 items) which the user can navigate
with the UP and DOWN arrow keys. Audible bell will occur if trying to access
beyond the history. In addition, users can use the BACKSPACE and DEL keys to
remove characters from current line.

When taking input from user, shell will print out the current directory followed
by the % sign to signal the current directory. If path is > 16 characters then
the path is written as /.../[LAST DIRECTORY IN PATH].

LIMATATIONS:

	Piping and Input redirection have not been implemented.
	Commands 'ff' and 'ls' have not been implemented.
