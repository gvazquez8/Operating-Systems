Use Enter Key to determine when command finishes

Read Character line by line

Maybe save whole command into single variable which you can process later?
	- Might use backspace so it would 'pop' the last character in character array



What I can't Use:

scanf, fscanf, printf, fprintf, cin, cout, or their derivatives (?)


MUST USE READ/WRITE system calls

Params to write(int fildes, const void* buf, size_t nbyte):

	fildes = file destination, use STDIN_FILENO
	buf = our output string, provide address of variable to print
	nbyte = size of buf. If you pass string, use string.length or .size
